      <p>Does this situation sound familiar?</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>You've got a big game-changing idea of how to change your organization but you don't know how to start.</li>
      	<li>You know your group has a ton of potential, but you seem to be stuck deciding which way to turn.</li>
      	<li>You're starting a big initiative but you don't know to track the costs, deadlines and tasks. It's overwhelming.</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>I can help.</p>
	  <p>I'm a project management consultant for organizations. I help you define your project and set up a process to complete it. I'll help you get organized and set up a plan. If you like, I can then oversee the project and guide you to success.</p>
	  <p>If you're struggling with your projects right now, let's have a quick call to understand your project and give you some clarity.</p>

      <ul>
      	<li>I've help a group of non-profits set up a software platform to find more creative space.</li>
      	<li>Strategized series strategize how to build their program across social media video platforms.</li>
      	<li>Create plans to help arts organizations win major project grants.</li>
      	<li>Ran major construction projects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I've learned a few things along the way:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Every organization and project is unique. There's no one-size-fits-all solution.</li>
      	<li>Once organizations start thinking about projects in a structured way and put a system in place, the results can be transformative. (You're closer to success than you think.)</li>
      	<li>Projects succeed best when everyone is on board. This means communication and leadership shared understanding of the issue. This means clear communication.</li>
